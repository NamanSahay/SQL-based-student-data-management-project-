# SQL-based-student-data-management-project-
A SQL-based Student Management System designed to handle academic data efficiently. It covers database creation, data entry, querying, and updates using MySQL. The project analyzes student performance through aggregation and conditional logic. Ideal for showcasing practical SQL skills in a real-world academic scenario.



# 🎓 SQL-Based Student Data Management Project

## 🧾 Introduction  
As part of a technical assessment conducted by *MAINFLOW Technologies, this SQL mini-project showcases hands-on expertise in managing relational databases. It involves end-to-end design and manipulation of a **Student Information System* using SQL — from database creation to advanced querying and data updates.

This simulation reflects a real-world academic data environment where student information, subject scores, and performance metrics are stored and analyzed efficiently.

## 💻 Tools & Technologies  
- *MySQL*
- *Structured Query Language (SQL)*
- *Data Definition Language (DDL)*
- *Data Query Language (DQL)*
- *Data Manipulation Language (DML)*

## 🗂 Project Contents

| File Name     | Role in the Project                            |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| TASK 1.sql  | Contains all SQL commands for database setup, data entry, analysis, and modifications |

## 🔍 Functional Highlights & SQL Tasks  

### ✅ 1. Database Setup  
- Initialized a database named Student_Managment (typo preserved for accuracy).
- Created one main table titled *Student*, including fields such as:
  - ID (Primary Key)
  - Name
  - Gender
  - Age
  - Academic_Grade
  - Subject-wise scores (e.g., Math, Science, English)

### 📥 2. Data Population  
- Entered *10 comprehensive student records* with varied profiles and academic backgrounds, simulating real-case educational data.

### 🧠 3. Data Processing & Insights  
- Pulled full student data using selection queries.
- Identified the highest scoring student based on total marks.
- Counted how many students fall under each *academic grade*.
- Calculated *gender-wise averages* in one or more subjects.
- Filtered students performing above average in areas like Math.

### 🔧 4. Data Modifications  
- Applied *conditional updates* to academic grades based on certain logic (e.g., improving a student's grade post-revaluation).


## 🧠 Learning Objectives Met  
This project strengthens proficiency in:

- *Designing tabular schema* from scratch.
- *Using SQL to derive academic insights* from raw data.
- Applying *aggregations* like AVG(), COUNT(), and GROUP BY.
- Performing *filtered queries* using logical conditions.
- Implementing *real-time updates* to records using UPDATE.

## 🎯 Conclusion  
This Student Database project serves as a comprehensive practice on essential SQL operations in a meaningful academic data context. It effectively reflects database design, real-world queries, and logical problem-solving through SQL — meeting the exact expectations of hands-on database assignments.
